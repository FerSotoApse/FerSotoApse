- 👋 Hi, I’m Fernanda, or just Fer!
- 👀 Mainly interested in design and architecture related projects, but I’m open to all knowledge
- 🌱 I’m a trainee currently perfecting my python coding skills and learning new machine learning/AI and data visualisation libraries while developing small solutions
- 💞️ Open to collaborate on machine/deep learning projects
- 📫 The fastest way to reach me: send me an <email>(fefy.sotoapse@outlook.com), or <connect with me>(http://linkedin.com/in/fersotoapse)
- ⚡ Fun fact: if there are drawings in my deployed personal projects, I painted those, Watercolour is my hobby!
